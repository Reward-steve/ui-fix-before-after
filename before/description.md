# ❌ Broken UI – What Was Wrong

This was an intentionally broken layout to demonstrate common UI problems seen in client projects:

- Cards had fixed widths and didn't scale on smaller screens
- Inline styles made the code hard to maintain
- Spacing between elements was inconsistent
- Buttons lacked visual hierarchy and accessibility
- Layout broke on mobile and tablet views
- Visual overload with excessive box shadows
