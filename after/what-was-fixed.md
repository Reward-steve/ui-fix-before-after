# ✅ UI Fix – What Was Improved

This is the cleaned, responsive, and production-ready version of the same UI:

- Replaced inline styles with Tailwind utility classes
- Used responsive grid (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3`)
- Unified spacing, padding, and alignment with Tailwind spacing scale
- Improved button accessibility and contrast
- Removed visual clutter (shadows, borders)
- Now fully mobile-first and scalable
- Layout now works across all devices and screen sizes
